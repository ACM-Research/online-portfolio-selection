# Comparison of Current Online Portfolio Selection Algorithms</h1>

**ACM Research, Spring 2021**

## Background

Online portfolio selection is a fundamental problem in computational finance which determines how to allocate wealth across a variety of assets to maximize return. In this project, participants will implement and benchmark the performance of some current approaches to this problem (as described in the scientific literature) on a variety of stock portfolios.

## Objective

> What state-of-the-art online portfolio selection algorithms perform the best when backtested on historical data?

## Project Timeline & Build Night Agendas

Available [here](timeline/README.md).

## Development Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment in the project root named `env`. See [the official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for more information in setting up virtual environments.
3. Install all required packages by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Begin development.

### Testing

To run tests: `python -m pytest`

To write tests:

- Create a new file in `tests/` and follow standard Pytest conventions to write tests.

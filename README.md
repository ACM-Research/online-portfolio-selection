## Background

Online portfolio selection is a fundamental problem in computational finance which determines how to allocate wealth across a variety of assets to maximize return. In this project, participants will implement and benchmark the performance of some current approaches to this problem (as described in the scientific literature) on a variety of stock portfolios.

## Objective

> What state-of-the-art online portfolio selection algorithms perform the best when backtested on historical data?

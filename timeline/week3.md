## General agenda items

- Discuss homework

## Homework

- **VERY IMPORTANT** Fill out the When2Meet on Slack ASAP so that I can reach out to Dr. Gupta to schedule a meeting.
- Read up to (but not including) Section 3.3 in the [OLPS survey paper](OLPSSurvey.pdf)
- Come up with questions to ask Dr. Gupta. Make sure you read up on his background before the meeting.
- Meet up with each other this week outside of build nights.
- Familiarize yourself with Python if you haven't already. A tutorial is available in Week 1's notes.
- ([Very] Optional) Curious about some advanced math you may see in the paper? Totally optional, but [here's a book that explains a lot of math used in machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf). We're technically not using ML for our project, but some of our update rules _do_ require constrained optimization (covered in chapter 7) and we definitely use a lot of matrix/vector operations (covered in chapter 2).
